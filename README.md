# Airport_Website
This website is designed in order to determine:
Whether the plane that will arrive at the airport will be delayed,Or will it arrive on time.
And this was done by:
* Downloading the dataset of all planes from Kaggle.
* Preparing this data using the libraries in Python.
* Choosing the appropriate model for this data, to give us very good expectations.
* Linking the model and the data to the site by using a framework
called Flask.
In order to test this system, We made a website using (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
It was a group project for Orange hackathon.
