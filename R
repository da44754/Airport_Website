# Airport_Website
This website is designed in order to determine:
•Whether the plane that will arrive at the airport will be delayed.
•Or will it arrive on time.
And this was done by:
1- Downloading the dataset of all planes from Kaggle.
2- Preparing this data using the libraries in Python.
3- Choosing the appropriate model for this data, to give us very good
expectations.
4- Linking the model and the data to the site by using a framework
called Flask.
In order to test this system, We made a website using (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
It was a group project for Orange hackathon.
